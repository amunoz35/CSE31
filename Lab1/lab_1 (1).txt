1. What does the -c flag do in gcc?
   The -c flag will suppress linking and will produce a .o file for the source  file 
   
2. What does the -o flag do in gcc?
   The -o flag places your output in the file it's being used.
   
3. How do you load output0 into gdb?
	gdb output0.c   

4. How do you set breakpoint at main?
	(gdb)break output0.c:main
   
5. Command to run output0 inside gdb
	(gdb)run output0
6. Command to single-step through the program
	(gbd)s
Part 2
7. What is the size (# of bits)of an assigned int?
	9223372036854775807
	
8. Second output gives the value of a long int. What is the size of a long long?
	64 bits
9. Is the size of a signed int the same as an unsigned int?
	Both ints and unsigned ints are either 2 or 4 bytes, having the same size;
	the only difference is the value range within, with unsigned ints going from 0 to 4,294,967,295
	and signed ints going from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 
10. What is the output and the reason for the value to be this way?
	This value would be, as stated earlier, a signed int reaching -2,147,483,648, flipping the remainding
	bits by one and reevaluating the value.(two's complement)

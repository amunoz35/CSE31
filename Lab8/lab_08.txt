Q1. 	Find a positive floating point value x, for which x+1.0 = x.  
		Verify your result using fp.s and tell us the hex representation of x. 
		
			One value that satisfies the equation is 2^23.
		
Q2.  	Find the smallest positive floating point value x for which x+1.0 = x.  
		State the hex representation of x. 
		
			2^23 is the smallest possible value.
			4B000000 is 2^23 in hex.
		
Q3.  	Determine a set of positive floating point numbers such that adding these numbers in a different order can yield a different value. 
		You can do this using only three numbers. (Hint: Experiment with adding up different amounts of the x value you determined in Q2, and the value 1.0). 
		
			These values will result in different values depending on the order of summation
			One set that works is 0 x 4B000000
			0 x 200000 and 0 x 300000
		
Q4.  	Based on your answer for Q3, do floating points obey associative rule like integers?   
		
			It doesn't seem that the floating points will have the same associated rule as integers.

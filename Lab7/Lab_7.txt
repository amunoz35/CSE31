1. The bug in swap2.s is that the temp pointer is dereferenced without
being initialized. Why might a programmer not notice this even after
testing the buggy swap? In other words: what situation would allow
buggy swap to seem to work correctly?
	
	The program will most likely not end with the proper syscall.
	
2. Explain how you guarantee it crashing with what is in proc.

	You can force a crash by making the proc access a memory location that 
	is not in the main method. Dereferencing it will cause the compiler
	to throw an error.
